 * I recommend to build project file by file as I had used two functions getch() this function
 * make me hold till get the input from user. It's found in conio.h but this is not supported
 * in CCS. Also, I had used system("cls") to keep terminal clean. we could neglect it but the
 * readability of terminal on code blocks.
 * In case of building the entire project you will get error for unresolved symbols.
